Spring Social is an extension of the Spring Framework that allows you to connect your applications with Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) API providers such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

## Features

* An extensible service provider framework that greatly simplifies the process of connecting local user accounts to hosted provider accounts.
* A connect controller that handles the authorization flow between your Java/Spring web application, a service provider, and your users.
* Java bindings to popular service provider APIs such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, TripIt, and GitHub.
* A sign-in controller that enables users to authenticate with your application by signing in through a service provider.
* Much more...
