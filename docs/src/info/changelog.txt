Spring Social 1.0.0 Release Candidate 2 (July 25, 2011)
=======================================================
Bug Fixes
   * Display a message indicating a user should sign-up after a provider
     sign-in is unable to find a matching local user. (SOCIAL-207)
   * When ConnectController is given an application URL, it now uses the
     entire URL to construct the callback URL instead of piecing together
     the callback URL from specific parts of it. (SOCIAL-200)
   * Use coalesce function in SQL rather than ifnull for greater DB
     compatibility. (SOCIAL-226)
   * Added cache-control headers in response for ConnectController status
     pages to prevent caching. (SOCIAL-224)
   * Made ConnectionKey to implement Serializable, so that DuplicateConnectionException
     can be serialized in the session. (SOCIAL-225)

Spring Social 1.0.0 Release Candidate 1 (June 22, 2011)
=======================================================
Compatibility Notes
   * Extracted provider-specific modules to separate projects.
   * Renamed {Provider}Api.java interfaces to {Provider}.java.
     (e.g. TwitterApi is now Twitter, FacebookApi is now Facebook, etc)
   * Renamed several operations in ConnectionRepository (see JavaDocs/source for details).
   * Renamed AbstractOAuth1ApiTemplate and AbstractOAuth2ApiTemplate to AbstractOAuth1ApiBinding and AbstractOAuth2ApiBinding, respectively.
   * Simplified ConnectController and ProviderSignInController constructors (see JavaDocs/source for details).
   * Moved ConnectController & ProviderSignInController's applicationUrl property from constructor to setter and made optional.
   * Renamed ConnectController#postLoginUrl property to postSignInUrl for consistency.
   * Renamed SignInService to SignInAdapter for clarity & added Connection, HttpServletRequest, and HttpServletResponse parameters to signIn method signature.
   * Factored out web.ConnectSupport from ConnectController and ProviderSignInController for reusability.
   * Removed commons-codec dependency; spring-security-crypto is now used for Base64 encoding as well as encryption.
  
New Features
   * Enabled use of Spring Social behind a proxy
   * Facebook API binding:
     * Photo and video upload

     * Notifications API
     * Geo API

   * Introduced super ApiBinding interface with isAuthorized() tester that can be used to determine if the application has been authorized to invoke the API on behalf of a user.

Bug Fixes
   * Fixed Spring 3.0 compatibility issues (SOCIAL-152)
   * Converted LinkedInTemplate response binding to be JSON-based, fixing a
     problem with Android compatibility (SOCIAL-148)
   * Fixed several JSON deserialization issues by either adding new fields to
     the model classes or by setting Jackson to ignore unknown properties.

   * Added setRequestFactory() methods to OAuth1Template and OAuth2Template to
     allow for customization of the request factory (SOCIAL-133)
   * AbstractOAuth1ApiBinding and AbstractOAuth2ApiBinding now create a RestTemplate
     with a minimal set of message converters. In doing so, they set "UTF-8" character
     set on FormHttpMessageConverter. (SOCIAL-170)
   * Handle DuplicateKeyException, putting "social.addConnection.duplicate" in request
     as flash variable and then into model so that view can inform user of the problem.
   * Fixed Android 8 (and lower) compatibility issue by creating a HttpComponents
     request factory that does not put an "Expect: 100-continue" header in the
     request (SOCIAL-144)
   * Added setSignUpUrl() to ProviderSignInController to enable configuration of
     the sign up page location (SOCIAL-183)
   * Changed TwitterErrorHandler and FacebookErrorHandler to those an
     UncategorizedApiException if an error response body is non-JSON (and thus does
     not match the expected error message response). (SOCIAL-173)
   * Made the applicationUrl property of ConnectController and ProviderSignInController
     optional, constructing the callback URL from information in the request (SOCIAL-187)
   * Create new SimpleDateFormat as-needed to fix thread safety problem (SOCIAL-198)
